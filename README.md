# Check Required Binaries are Installed

We know that in the projects we use lots of binaries with required versions to work on that, This is the utility script to check the required binaries with the specified versions.

```
Version.txt 

##
# File contains the required binaries with version
# Versions for required installed binaries
# Format is binary: version
# If the binary version can be any use the wildcard character '*'
##
```

It is also beneficial to check the required binaries into our CI/CD pipelines before start executing
